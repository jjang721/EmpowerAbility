As a long-time volunteer at a special education center near my home, I wanted to bring others closer together through a messaging app. I knew that I wanted to have lots of details to help people with disabilities, so I added features such as specific colors on text bubbles and easy ways to manage chat boxes. I hope this can bring my community closer together for everyone to connect!
